One of the first games I ever programmed, was a maze game where the only thing you could see where the walls directly next to you, as you moved more of the walls became visible until you found the exit.

It is funny to look back and see that as a kid you were already programming algorythms and procedural generation while having (at that time) not a clue about both concepts. 

![Secret Maze](/images/secretmazepcb.jpg){: .align-right} I was very excited when a couple of weeks ago I found a project [1] where someone has done this with the AVR attiny 85 (an cheap 8 pin microcontroller) with 4 buttons for direction and 4 leds that show the walls if present.

so after ordering the pcb, the parts and some soldering I was able to program the AT85 with an AVR programmer i have lying around. i made some small adjustment to the code, mostly involving a visual signal when you reached the exit as I couldn't find a buzzer that worked ;)

![Including Case](/images/maze_game.png){: .align-left}  Being in the possesing of a 3D printer also prompted me to design a case for it [2] 

This is an ideal project to get kids involved in the whole makerspace, the soldering skills are not advanced, Ideally you would have a 3d printer, but you would to print them in advance anyways so you could also order them online. 

For me I can't wait until my niece and nephew get a little bit older so I can introduce them to the wonderful world of makers.
