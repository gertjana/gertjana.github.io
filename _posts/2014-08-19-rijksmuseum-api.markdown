I really like the innovative approach of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

I just found out that they put high-resolution pictures of their entire collection [online](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/rijksstudio). and the even provide an [API](http://rijksmuseum.github.io/) to query it.

I'm thinking:

* Random paintings in virtual reality environments
* When using "lorum ispum" for text why not famous paintings as placeholder images.
* Screensaver's
* Re-work an old monitor as digital frame on the wall
* Chrome cast / Apple TV app

etc. etc.

well done rijksmuseum!!
